== Description ==
The ACF icon plugin adds a new field to ACF that enables users to select an icon from a popup.
It works with ACF Repeater fields.
It supports both font icons and SVG icons. You can select if the field should return
* CSS class
* SVG url fragment
* SVG file path
* SVG raw (the SVG markup)

You cannot limit to certain icons or add new icon providers as of writing which is version 0.1.3.

If you are using ACF functions the_field() with CSS class return format you need to enqueue the required CSS.
